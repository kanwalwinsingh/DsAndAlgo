Tree:- A tree is a hierarchical structure that consist of nodes that are connected using pointers(edges).
In a tree a cycle cannot exists.
Sub-tree:- a subtree is a portion of tree that can be viewed as a complete tree on its own.
Degree:- The degree of a node referes to the total number of sub-trees of a node.
Depth:- The number of connections(edges) from the root to a node is known as depth of that node.
level:- depth of node +1
Height o a node:- the maximum number of connections between the node and a leaf node in its path is known as the height of node.
Height of a tree:- the height of its root node.

Most common trees are:-
1) n-ary tree, balanced tree, Binary tree, BinarySearch Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, 2-3 tree.

balanced tree- its a tree in which almost all the leaf nodes are present at the same level
height(tree) = O(log2(nodes)) i.e height(leftsubtree) - height(rightsubtree)| <=1

Types of Binary tree:-
Complete Binary tree:- all levels are filled except possible the last one

, full binary tree, perfect binary tree
